# Time Tracking - Static Design Mock-Up
## Real world time tracking solution

[live demo](http://barbarahernandez.github.io/timetrackingsite)

### Use Case
This application was created for use by a small company with very straightforward time tracking needs. For this application, there is no need to split hours among clients or projects, only to identify how many hours of paid work/vacation/sick leave need to be recorded for each employee. The employees should be able to log on and edit their own timesheets, as well as see older timesheets. Administrators should be able to see all timesheets for all users and also be able to edit them.

### About Design
This application uses bootstrap, but also a lot of custom branding for the intended company. The layout is intended to be easily understood and as quick as possible for users to view and edit time sheets.

This is a static design mock up which includes features which, in production will be separated out into Employee and Administrator views.
